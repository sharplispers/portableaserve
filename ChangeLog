	Brendan Burns to Franz's opensource list

2002-07-07  Rudi Schlatte  <rudi@constantly.at>

* cmucl version now uses asdf instead of mk-defsystem:

** Added directory contrib, contrib/asdf.lisp

** Added acl-compat/acl-compat.asd, aserve/aserve.asd,
   aserve/htmlgen/htmlgen.asd (thanks to David Lichteblau for the asd
   files)

** Updated README.cmucl, README

* Changed client.cl to use http/1.0 (Remember to revert this when chunking
  is implemented!) (Thanks to David Lichteblau for bug report & patch)

Changes in Portable AllegroServe 1.2.5a (2001-08-30)
- Chunking implemented for Lispworks.
- Fixed problem in Lispworks port with accepting too many connections
  (and consequently running out of file descriptors) under heavy load.
- Incorporated changes in AllegroServe between versions 1.2.3 and 1.2.5.

Changes in Portable AServe 1.2.3b (09.08.2001)
- Fixed bug with POST requests
- General code cleanup
- implemented some missing ACL-COMPAT functions

Changes in AServe for LW 1.2.3a (06.08.2001)
- Rudolf Schlatte's changes for supporting CMUCL
  merged.
- Several critical bugs fixed (like the lockup of worker-threads
  that occured on higher load).
  (Thanks go to Vebjorn Ljosa for finding and fixing this and other
   critical bugs)
- Updated Portable AllegroServe to the changes in Franz AllegroServe 1.2.3

Changes in AServe for LW 1.1.41b (02.06.2001)
- Fixed reloading of pages
  Wade Humeniuk kindly contributed a DATE-TO-UNIVERSAL-TIME
  function that doesn't use MATCH-REGEXP.

Changes in ACL-COMPAT (02.06.2001)
- MATCH-REGEXP got a Keyword argument :return
- Much improved MP:WITH-TIMEOUT using LispWorks timers and not 
  a new process for each timer.	
- Fixed a bug in scan-macros.lisp where complementing of charsets
  did not really work.
