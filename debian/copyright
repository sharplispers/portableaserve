Prequel to the Gnu Lesser General Public License

Copyright (c) 2000 Franz Inc., Berkeley, CA 94704

Franz Inc. has adopted the concept of the GNU Lesser General Public
License version 2.1 ("LGPL") to govern the use and distribution of
AllegroServe.  However, LGPL uses terminology that is more appropriate
for a program written in C than one written in Lisp.  Nevertheless,
LGPL can still be applied to a Lisp program if certain clarifications
are made.  This document details those clarifications.
